# Microsoft Teams Clone
Hey Code geek, welcome to my project 'Microsoft Teams Clone'. It was under the challenge of Engage Mentorship program 2021 by Microsoft. Its been a great journey and quite insightful too.
<br/>
Challenge was basically about connecting two people on teams via video calling. On above of that I incorporated following features:
* Group Video Calling
* Chat
* Screen Share
* Screen Recording
* Transcript
* Authorization

# Agile Implementation
The Development was a series of Continous Integration and contionous Deployment. Each functionality was divided in weeks under SCRUM.  Each sprintâ€™s goal was to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product.
